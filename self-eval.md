# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

It honestly felt really great. These last assignments were easily the most challenging and really required me to apply everything I've learned, but I felt like I understood how to tackle the challenges and find what I needed, and it was very satisfying to test my work and see it work as intended.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

I still have a lot of room to improve here, especially in terms of overarching scheduling. But I am trying to be mindful of taking breaks and my need for rest, and I'm definitely better off now than when I started.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

I would say thorough testing methodology. I'm starting to see how important it is to thoroughly test, and design comprehensive and encompassing test cases.

Several times I've received expected results on test cases and erroneously concluded that my code was fully functional, when it was only partially or even non-functional; I simply hadn't tested enough to realize.
